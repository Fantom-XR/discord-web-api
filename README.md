# :interrobang: What are the advantages of API

**From here you can add very nice touches to your site or application, for example in the attached picture below. This is a special site of my bot, and in the information page for developers, I used this api to fetch information about the developers name, avatar, etc. ... and the code also found at the bottom. The code used in the explanation is just an example of what you can take advantage of the api, and this of course you can do to fetch information about a specific guild.**
